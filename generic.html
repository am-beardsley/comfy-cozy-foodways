								<p>Hey there, fellow foodies! I'm Bridgette Evans, a 20-year-old junior studying English Education at Western Illinois University, hailing from the heart of Western Illinois. Currently navigating the exciting world of English, I find solace and joy in the simple pleasures of life â€“ and, of course, in the delightful world of comfort foods.
									<p>As a junior in college, my days are filled with lectures, study sessions, and the occasional late-night cramming for exams. Amidst the hustle, I discovered an escape in the realm of comfort foods. These dishes aren't just about satisfying hunger; they're about creating a moment of joy in the midst of a hectic day.
									<p>This blog, a project for my English 388 class, "Writing for the Web," is a window into my culinary adventures and a celebration of all things comforting. Join me as I explore a variety of comfort foods that resonate with the soul, from classic favorites to hidden gems waiting to be discovered.
										<p>Living and studying in Western Illinois has shaped my appreciation for hearty, homey dishes that bring people together. From cozy diners to family-owned eateries, I've been inspired by the local flavors that make this region unique. Expect a sprinkle of Midwestern warmth in most of these posts.
										<p>In this cozy corner of the internet, I'll be sharing not just recipes but the stories behind them. Each dish is a journey, a memory, or sometimes just a comforting escape from the challenges of college life. Get ready for a blend of nostalgia, creativity, and, most importantly, the joy that good food brings.
										<p>Whether you're a college student seeking quick and budget-friendly recipes or someone looking to rediscover the comforting tastes of home, this blog is for you. Let's embark on a culinary journey together, one comforting bite at a time.
										<p>I'm thrilled to have you along for this delicious ride! Feel free to drop by the comments section and share your favorite comfort foods or reach out on social media. Together, we'll make this space a hub of warmth, laughter, and, of course, fantastic food.
										<p>Listed below is my design Philosophy for this website. 
											<h1>Design Philosophy</h1>
										<p>Creating accessible websites is no longer a luxury but an absolute necessity. As highlighted in the book "A Web for Everyone," designing for universal usability is not just a best practice; it's a strategic approach to achieve a clear purpose. By focusing on essential features and eliminating non-essential elements, accessible design results in a superior product that is not only purposeful but also user-friendly for everyone (Horton & Quesenbery, 2014, p. 38).

										<p>At the core of our philosophy, mirroring that of Western Illinois University, is inclusivity. We believe that every individual, regardless of their abilities, deserves equal access to resources, information, and opportunities. To achieve this, our platform is meticulously designed with universal principles. Universal design, a central tenet, ensures our platform is usable by the widest audience, considering diverse needs and perspectives. This commitment creates a digital space where everyone feels valued, respected, empowered, and fully capable of participating and interacting.
											
										<p>In the pursuit of an inclusive digital experience, we prioritize a user-centered approach. Our website is crafted to be not just user-friendly but user-centered. Placing the needs, preferences, and limitations of our users at the forefront of our design process, we aim to create an experience that is not just accessible but profoundly beneficial for all.</p>
